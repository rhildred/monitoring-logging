# monitoring-tracing
a template for monitoring and tracing in codespaces

TLDR;

```
sudo ansible-playbook postgres.yml
python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

Add another terminal and run `pgadmin4` as well.

This is intended as a little introduction to monitoring and tracing that is already in linux. Specifically:

1. top
2. ps
3. strace
4. netstat
5. lsof
6. postgres logs
7. pgadmin4

The lab is to do some research in to what these commands do, and try it out.

I hope that this is fun!
